# Rocket_Game

I've developed a Rocket Game for Windows using C# and Unity. By combining the flexibility of C# with Unity's game development environment, I aimed to create an enjoyable gaming experience with visually appealing graphics. The game features dynamic gameplay, thanks to the capabilities offered by Unity. I focused on ensuring a smooth and engaging experience for players, taking care to optimize performance while maintaining a visually pleasing aesthetic.

The game is ready to play by downloading the content and opening "3_Project_Boost.exe"
